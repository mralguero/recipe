Instructions
Make the caramel
Place the sugar (and water, if using) in a saucepan over medium heat.
Let it melt without stirring until it turns golden.
Quickly pour it into the flan mold, coating the bottom.
Prepare the flan
In a bowl, lightly beat the eggs (avoid creating too much foam).
Add the condensed milk and mix well.
Add the whole milk and vanilla; stir gently.
Bake in a water bath
Pour the mixture into the caramelized mold.
Place the mold inside a larger baking dish filled with hot water.
Bake at 350°F (180°C) for 45–55 minutes, or until a knife inserted comes out clean.
Cool and serve
Let cool at room temperature, then refrigerate for at least 4 hours.
Unmold and serve cold
